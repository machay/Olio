Usability:
The first thing the user sees on the site is the log in page. If the user is not a member, they are able to select the “Not a Member” link which takes them to a register page. The form takes in the user’s personal information and validates the information before allowing the user to register. Once the user is logged they are presented with their own portfolio page. On the edit page, the user is able to edit their personal information and upload up to five images to the site. The header is consistent across all of the different pages to help the user return or go to their desired page. The team decided that there should be both a logo and a Home link because the user may expect the logo to also return to the landing page. 
For Olio, the team focused on creating a minimalistic, neutral website in order to enhance the visibility of the artwork that would be displayed on the site. Responsive design was desirable to let the website be seen on multiple screen sizes. This would allow interviewers to access the artwork conveniently using whatever device they have on hand. Artists would be able to carry tablets to present their portfolio which would be more reliable than expecting a particular screen size. Artists often have minor issues of having their portfolio display incorrectly on another person’s laptop.
