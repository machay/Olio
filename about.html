				<p>		Olio is an application that allows users to create, share, and expand their online portfolios with digital pictures, highlighted work, and personal biographies.</p> 

			<p class = "titles">Background:</p>
				<p>		Across the wide array of majors available to prospective college-bound students in the U.S., one of the most difficult (economically-speaking) majors to earn a living on is the ever-appealing art major.  Similar to history, political science, and automotive engineering majors, artists either have a significantly lower starting salary than other majors and experience the slowest growth in earnings over time in their craft.  Our project seeks to give these users tools to increase their exposure, format their works as they see fit, and pursue the connections they need to avoid the financial trials of their line of work. 

					Due to economic circumstances, there are currently less job openings in the 
				market, consequently making it harder for newly-graduated college students/artists/any unemployed person to get a job.  Our applicationâ€™s purpose is to aid unemployed people with the hiring process by allowing users to increase their exposure through an online portfolio that allows them to exhibit their work.</p> 

			<p class = "titles">Users:</p>
				<p>		Designed for professional portfolios, users will have an easy-to-access hub to organize their achievements and job prospects and present this relevant information to employers.  Artists may also use this application to upload their artwork and showcase their talent.  Employers will also be able to showcase their projects to allure applicants.</p>

			<p class = "titles">Technologies:</p>
				<p>HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, XML. jQuery: very possible for additional plug-ins to be implemented as we find use for them!</p>
				
			<p class = "titles">Functional Requirements:</p>
				<p>File transfer and remembered user database, formatting tools, and content creation forms.</p>
